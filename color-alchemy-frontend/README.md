This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Go to the ../color-alchemy-server and run the development server

2. Back to this folder (color-alchemy-frontend) and run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The game is made with the assumption of :
width is between 10 - 20,
height is between 4-10,
maxMoves is between 8-20,
the first 3 rgb color must be set to 3 different sources, and only after that, dragging and dropping of tile to source is allowed
